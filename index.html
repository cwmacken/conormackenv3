They were upfront and accurate about the cost of each new piece of functionality they added, and had excellent communication throughout the whole process which ensured we got what exactly we wanted. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him.</p>

I was having some issues with my Shopify theme that I came to learn required coding and an expert to help fix them. I reached out to Conor and he was communicative, honest, prompt, professional and completely upfront with cost. He got the job I needed done for my site, done perfectly. Conor was available and easy to communicate with throughout the process of working together and I felt like my site was in the absolute best hands. I would highly recommend him to anyone!</p>
